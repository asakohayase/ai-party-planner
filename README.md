Strands Agents SDK Demo: "Agents as Tools" Pattern
A demonstration project showcasing the Strands Agents SDK's "Agents as Tools" pattern through an intelligent party planning system. This project implements a hierarchical multi-agent architecture where a Party Director coordinates three specialized agents to create comprehensive party plans.

Agents as Tools                                          Regular Tool

Core Implementation
1. Party Director (Orchestrator)
The main agent coordinates specialists based on user requirements:
pythonfrom strands import Agent
from .food_specialist import food_drink_specialist
from .theme_specialist import theme_decoration_specialist
from .activity_specialist import activity_entertainment_specialist

PARTY_DIRECTOR_PROMPT = """
You are a Party Director AI that coordinates specialized party planning agents.

You have access to these tools:
- food_drink_specialist: for menu planning and drinks
- theme_decoration_specialist: for decorations and themes  
- activity_entertainment_specialist: for games and activities

Based on what the user wants planned, call the appropriate specialists and combine their responses into a comprehensive party plan.

Always structure your response with clear sections and provide practical, actionable advice.
Focus on the specific planning aspects the user requested.
"""

party_director = Agent(
    system_prompt=PARTY_DIRECTOR_PROMPT,
    tools=[
        food_drink_specialist,
        theme_decoration_specialist,
        activity_entertainment_specialist,
    ],
)
2. Specialist Agents as Tools
Each specialist is wrapped with the @tool decorator, making them callable by the orchestrator:
pythonfrom strands import Agent, tool

ACTIVITY_SPECIALIST_PROMPT = """
You are an Activity & Entertainment Specialist for home parties in the US. Focus on:
- Activity suggestions based on duration and group size
- Entertainment ideas for different age groups
- Games requiring minimal setup and common items

Provide engaging, easy-to-execute entertainment ideas with clear instructions and material lists.
"""

@tool
def activity_entertainment_specialist(party_details: str) -> str:
    """
    Handle activity and entertainment planning for home parties.

    Args:
        party_details: Detailed party information including guest ages, duration, etc.

    Returns:
        Comprehensive activity and entertainment plan with setup instructions
    """
    try:
        activity_agent = Agent(system_prompt=ACTIVITY_SPECIALIST_PROMPT)
        response = activity_agent(party_details)
        return str(response)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error in activity & entertainment planning: {str(e)}"
